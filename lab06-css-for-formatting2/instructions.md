# Lab 6 – CSS for Formatting, part 2
*Due: Wednesday, February 13, 2019 (two lab sessions - one week!)*<br>

The purpose of this lab is to take what you've learned in CSS and experiment with it so you end-up with a completely different looking webpage. Feel free to create your own design. Your work will not be graded on its aesthetic value, however whatever you do, all the content must still be usable and readable.

Also, do *not* try to position elements on your webpage yet.  We'll cover that in the next topic and lab assignment.  For now, just focus on things like:

- "the box model," borders, margin, padding
- colors, text and backgounds
- fonts, sizes, styles, weights, and font-families
- gradients, border radius, text shadows …stuff like that

Create classes and add them to your HTML elements, but be sure to leave the location of the structural elements (HEADER, ARTICLE, ASIDE, and FOOTER) as-is.

## Step 1: Make a copy of Lab 5

-   After you’ve completed Lab 5 make a copy of all the files in it to a new folder named **lab06**

## Step 2: Change/Add styles to your webpage using CSS

For this lab, most of the work you do will be in the **styles.css** file. You will edit the HTML file only to add classes to elements as needed. You may also edit the HTML file to add non-semantic elements like DIVs and SPANs as needed too.

-   Remove ALL the style declarations you wrote from Lab 5



General instructions to keep in mind while you create the new design:

-   You must continue to use CSS correctly, placing all styles in a separate, external file that is connected to the HTML document using the LINK tag. 
-   There must be no styles or incorrectly used HTML elements in the HTML document.
-   Do not alter the *Normal Document Flow*. At this time, we're only creating *embellishments* to our web page, i.e. font changes; box model changes; things that alter elements' appearances but not their position. (We'll start the topic of *layout* in the next lecture.)

Bare minimums:

-   Change **colors**, **font-stacks**, **sizes**, anything, but make sure any changes you make, make sense. I.e., don't change a margin or padding from 15px to 500px (that'd be weird). Continue to keep in mind: readability and usability.

-   Create and use **at least three CSS classes**

-   Create and use at least **two different kinds of CSS pseudo classes** *besides* `:hover`

-   The final design must look "considerably different" than Lab 5

## Step 3: Upload your work

When you are done with your webpage, close everything and use an FTP tool (like *WinSCP* or *Cyberduck*) to access your account on **csc170.org** and upload your **lab06** folder.

-   In a web browser, go to this address to check your handiwork:  
    **csc170.org/accountname/lab06/start.html**  
    (where “*accountname*” is your account name)

Remember: All files and folder names must always be all lowercase and no spaces.

## Step 4: Report your work

-   Remember: Use the W3C HTML validator (**https://validator.w3.org/**) AND the W3C CSS validator (**http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator**) to check your work before you report it!
-   In our Blackboard section, in Lab 6, post a link to your webpage to receive credit for this Lab.
