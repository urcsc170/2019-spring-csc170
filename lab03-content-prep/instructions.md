# Lab 3: Content Preparation

*Due: Wednesday, January 30, 2019*

For this assignment, you need to gather content and prepare it for the web. You will copy content from Wikipedia (*not* Shakespeare!) and fulfill the requirements as described in this document.

Note: There is nothing technical about this lab assignment. You simply must have good content that you will use for the following lab assignments.

Look at the [EXAMPLE (ZIP)](example.zip). 

## 1. Gather Text Content

Go to Wikipedia and find a topic that interests you and has enough content for this assignment. Collect enough content in plain text, images and links.

-   Create a Word Document named **lab03-yourname.docx** (where *yourname* is your name).

-   In it, copy and paste enough content to create *at least* the elements listed in the [Elements (parts) You Need...](#elements-parts-you-need) section, below

    -   When you copy & paste text into your Word document, paste as **Plain Text** (do not try to style the Word document. Just make the headings obvious.)
    -   Clean-up the paragraphs. (Delete the square brackets, et cetera.)
    -   Remember: the goal of this assignment is just to find and hold-on to content that you’ll turn into web pages for your future lab assignments.

### Elements (parts) You Need...

The overall word count for the content you collect must be above about 1,000 words or so - so you have enough content to work with in the following labs.  No one will count exactly how many words you use unless it looks like there isn't enough.

-   A title (this will act as a first level heading)
-   A subtitle (most Wikipedia pages don't have subtitles. You can just make one up.)
-   At least four second level headings
-   At least three paragraphs of text associated with *each* of the first three second level headings; each paragraph should be at least 50 words (more is better)
-   At least two lists with at least seven items each: unordered, ordered or definition list (any combination); they must appear under the last second level heading
-   At least three references and/or external links with their complete text and hypertext-links to other sources 
    -   NOTE: copy & paste the URLs right in the text next to each citation
-   One more citation, referring to the source of the Wikipedia page(s) you used in this assignment

Note: you can slop together any related content as you need to make the assignment whole which includes: taking content from more than one Wikipedia page; writing a little bit of content yourself (for simple headers or captions, as needed). The assignment requires "real" content, but will not be graded for quality.

#### Example

Look at the [EXAMPLE (ZIP)](example.zip). When you’re done with this lab, you should have a document that kinda looks like that but with different content.

## 2. Gather and Prepare Images

Also required with your submission of the Word document, you need to provide at least two image files (usually JPGs).

-   IMPORTANT: do *not* embed the image files in the Word document - keep them as separate files.

-   Download and prepare *at least* two images from your Wikipedia page(s)

    -   The images must be between about 200 and  350 piexel wide
    -   Most likely, the images will be larger than 350px. If so you must use image editing software resize them  
        *Just about any photo editing software will do. You can use Photoshop which is installed on the University computers but that'd be overkill. On Windows machines, try Paint. On Macs, try Preview.*
    -   Rename the image files as needed to make them simple, e.g. shakespeare.jpg
    -   Make sure the names of the image files follow the industry standard of: all lower case, no spaces

## 3: Upload your work

When you've gathered your text content in a Word document and prepared at least two image files upload them to the Lab 3 Lab Assignment in Blackboard

Note: Upload the files to Blackboard separately. Do not ZIP/compress them.
