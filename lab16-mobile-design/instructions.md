# Lab 16: Mobile Design
*Due: Wednesday, April 24, 2019 (one week)*

NOTE: the flow of this lab assignment is different compared to our other labs.  Instead of being written like a step-by-step recipe, you need to use the instructions here like a checklist.  Everyone's lab website is different so what exactly you need to do will be unique to everyone.

## Step 1: Copy Lab 15

- Make a copy of your Lab 15 - put it in a folder named **lab16**
- In the **html-top.inc** file, update the TITLE tag to "Lab 16..."

## Step 2 Re-write the Website CSS

You need to make your website "mobile friendly" which, for this lab is: **375 x 667px** (the size of an iPhone 6, 7, or 8 in portrait mode); at this size your website must...

- [ ] Show no horizontal scroll bars
- [ ] Have all elements fit their containers
- [ ] Show text that is not too small to read comfortably, and there must be a lot of contrast between text color and its background
- [ ] Show images that are still recognizable for what they are, i.e. not too small
- [ ] Have navigation elements that look like buttons and they are finger-sized (easily tap-able)

## Suggestions...

Keep in mind, everyone's design is different.  Exactly what you need to do to make your website mobile-friendly depends on your design choices.

#### Meta Viewport Tag

*Everyone needs to do this...*

- [ ] Install the meta META VIEWPORT tag in your **html-top.inc** so it appears on every webpage

#### Media Queries

- Open your **styles.css** file, **home.css** file, and **navigation.css** file for editing

- Find your "breakpoints" and then figure out what CSS you need to change using *media queries* to fix the breakage.  

   - Remember: whatever media queries you write must appear *below* the original CSS you're changing
   - When looking for breakpoints, find the first one (only) and work on fixing it before going on to the next breakpoint.

   **Example Media Queries that *might* work on your website (with some customization)...**

   Here are some examples which may or may not work for your lab website  You need to alter these examples as needed for your website:

   - The *horizontal navigation bar* might cause horizontal scroll bars to appear at some point; say it happens at viewport width: 600px (yours will probably be different!) you would write in your **navigation.css** file:

     ```css
     @media (max-width: 600px) {
     	.main-menu ul, .main-menu li { display: block; } 
     }
     ```

     ...this will work regardless if you used inline-block, table-cell, or flex to layout your menu items side-by-side.  (NOTE: if you did not use ".main-menu" you need to use whatever *you* used)

   - You will also need to remove the styles you wrote to put the ARTICLE and ASIDE side-by-side at some point; say it happens at viewport with 730px (again, yours will probably be different!) you would write in your **styles.css** file:

     ```css
     @media (max-width: 730px) {
     	.container { display: block; } /* ...this will un-do CSS Grid on the container */
     } 
     ```

   - You will probably need to remove the styles you wrote to float your FIGURE elements because they do weird things to the text that flows around them at small viewport widths; say it happens at viewport with 500px (again, yours will probably be different!) you would write in your **styles.css** file:

     ```css
     @media (max-width: 500px) {
          figure {
               float: none;
               margin-left: initial;
          }
     } 
     ```

   - Take a look at your *homepage*.  At small widths you'll probably need to un-do the side-by-side positioning of the elements in your "hero" element; say you need to add a breakpoint at 650px (again, yours will probably be different!) you would write in your **home.css** file something like this:

     ```css
     @media (max-width: 650px) {
          .inner-container { display: block; } /* ...this will un-do CSS Grid on the container */
     }
     ```

#### Images

You may or may not need to do the following, depending on your images and where they're positioned in your webpages:

- Create a class that you can put on your image files to make them "flexible"


```css
.flexible {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 200px; /* ...or 250, or 300 ...adjust this as needed */
}
```

- Open for editing all your webpages that have embedded IMG elements 

- Add the `class="flexible"` (or another descriptive name that you choose) *only* to the IMG elements as needed - not necessarily all of them - only the ones where it's needed, if any.

#### Other things

You need to go through each webpage in your website systematically - looking at each webpage at wide and narrow viewport widths.  Whenever anything looks funky, you need to identify what is causing the problem and you need to fix it.  Typically, you'll need to write a media query - that's your best tool in your "tool bag."  Refer to your lecture notes from the previous lecture on Mobile Design.

## Step 3: Check and Upload your Work

When you are done with your lab website, close everything and use an FTP tool to access your account on **csc170.org** and upload your files:

- In a web browser (any), go to this address to check your handiwork:  
  **www.csc170.org/accountname/lab16**  
  (where “*accountname*” is your account name)

## Step 4: Report your work

- In our Blackboard section, in Lab 16, post a link to your webpage to receive credit for this Lab.
